Implement and evaluate the results of training in a simulation environment using Deep Q-Learning and ARZ on a real-world robot.

# Introduction to My Project

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share my latest project with you â€“ a bionic bipedal robot named Mikkelsen that mimics the intricate and efficient structure of bird legs. This isn't just any robot; it's designed to revolutionize the way we approach bipedal locomotion, leveraging advanced technologies like reinforcement learning.

# What I'm Building

I'm developing Mikkelsen, a bionic bipedal robot that accurately replicates the leg mechanics of birds. This robot isn't just a marvel of engineering; it's a platform for cutting-edge research in robotics and artificial intelligence. Here's what makes this project special:

- Bionic Design: Inspired by the anatomy of bird legs, Mikkelsen aims to achieve natural and efficient walking patterns.

- Reinforcement Learning: Using deep Q-learning and Augmented Random Search (ARS), Mikkelsen learns to walk in a simulated environment. This ensures robust performance when transitioning to real-world conditions.

- Affordable Hardware: One of my core goals is to make advanced robotics accessible. Mikkelsen will be built with low-cost materials, keeping the final product under $1000.
